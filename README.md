# Pair Programming
This assignment is meant to help practice communication and thinking through problems. 
We were tasked with picking a partner, and rotating between the roles of driver and navigator.

The task was to build a list of features and display their progress. Each issue has a progress level 
from 0 to 1 representing how complete it is; 0 indicating no work is done yet and 1 indicating complete. 
We loaded the data into a Backbone collection, and display it on the screen.

The data was to be rendered twice. Once using Backbone.View and the another using React. 
We also needed to come up with a creative way for displaying the progress.
The finalized project can be seen at: http://sarrahv.github.io/tiy-assignment-27/
